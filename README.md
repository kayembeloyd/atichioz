## About Atichioz

I am Lloyd Kayembe and am learning web development. This is a website for jobs

Right from the start i make a mistake in naming this project. It was supposed to be Atichoz instead of Atichioz. 

This was supposed to be like zochita when read backwards but this mistake means it reads zoichita. Which doesnt make sense
